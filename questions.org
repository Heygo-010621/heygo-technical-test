1. Logs "2" to the console. Then after 100ms logs "1" to the console.
   - =setTimeout= triggers Web API timeout
   - =setTimeout= finishes execution and Web API waits 100ms
   - =console.log("2")= executes and "2" logged to console
   - timeout expires after 100ms, callback function added to event loop
   - all code in current execution environment has complete -> call stack cleared
   - event loop checked for code to be executed, callback added to call stack
   - callback executed, =console.log("1")= pushed onto stack
   - =console.log("1")= executes and "1" logged to console
2. Prints every integer from 10 down to 0
   - =foo(0)= called
   - passes inner condition
   - current function paused + execution context added to stack
   - execute nested function, =foo(1)=
   - this continues until d=10
   - then condition fails and 10 is logged to console
   - then previous execution context popped from stack
   - function continues, 9 logged to console
   - and so on until 0 logged to console and everything popped from stack

3. Function will return default response of 5 for any Javascript falsy value, eg.
   - false
   - 0
   - ""
   - null
   - undefined
   - NaN
    which may not be the desired behaviour.
4. Logs 3 to the console

   =bar= holds a reference to an instance of the inner function, created when =foo(1)= was run

   The instance of that function maintained a reference to its lexical environment where =a=1=

   That function + lexical environment forms a _closure_.
   Then when =bar(2)= is executed, 2 is added to =a=, which in =bar='s lexical environment is 1.
   That sums to 3 which is what gets returned.
5. You:
   - Have a custom function you want to run
   - On twice the input value
   - After a 100ms delay
