* Description
- Enter 2 or more characters into the search box input.
- The app will search a database of around 59k points of inerest in the UK, for names that begin with the input.
- The results will be displayed, sorted by the closest match (using match length).
* Live
Site is live here: https://serene-taiga-17836.herokuapp.com/
Deploy any changes to heroku via:
#+begin_src sh
$ git push heroku master
#+end_src

* Dev

Run both applications on separate ports and set up react proxy to route API calls to Express server.
Running client using development server gives many benefits (hot reloading, linting, etc.)

** DB
#+begin_src sh
$ cd ./server/data
$ sqlite3 locations.db

sqlite> create table locations (geonameid text, name text);
sqlite> .separator "\t"
sqlite> .import locations.tsv locations
#+end_src
** Server
In the root of the project:
#+begin_src sh
$ npm i
$ npm start
#+end_src

This will start the server, running on: http://localhost:3001
** Client
#+begin_src sh
$ cd ./client
$ npm i
$ npm start
#+end_src

This will start the React client on: http://localhost:3000

* Prod

For production build, want optimised (pre-compiled, minified, bundled) React application.
Then using Express to serve both:
- search API requests
- React static files

This means we only have a single application running.

** Steps

1. Setup DB as above.
2. From the root of the project:
#+begin_src sh
$ npm run build        # Builds React application for prod

$ npm i                # Install npm packages for server
$ npm start            # Run the server
#+end_src
